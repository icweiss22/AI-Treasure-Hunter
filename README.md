**Stacker AI for Ladder Game**

**Overview**
The Stacker AI project is an advanced implementation of an intelligent agent designed for a grid-based ladder game. In this challenging environment, the AI navigates through a dynamic map to find and collect a treasure, represented as gold, while overcoming obstacles and utilizing blocks to reach elevated areas.

**Features**
Advanced Pathfinding: Utilizes A* algorithm for efficient navigation.
Line-of-Sight Detection: Employs Bresenham's algorithm to detect visible paths.
Dynamic Exploration: Implements intelligent exploration strategies to discover uncharted areas of the map.
Adaptive Decision Making: Makes real-time decisions based on the environment and game state.
Technologies
TypeScript: For robust typing and object-oriented approach.
HTML5 and JavaScript: For rendering the game environment and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

**Getting Started**

To run the Stacker AI:
- Clone the repository.
- Open the game's HTML file in a web browser.
- Watch the AI agent navigate the map in search of the gold.
