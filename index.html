    <h1>Treasure Hunter Challenge</h1>
    <p><b>Summary:</b> Your job is to write the code for the mind of an agent in a game to find a treasure.</p>
    <p>
      The map the game takes place on is randomly generated with scattered obstacles, stackable blocks, and walls. Somewhere on the map,
      there is a tower with the treasure on top. To attain this treasure, your agent must stack blocks and build a staircase.
    </p>
    <p>The objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write clean and functional code for an agent. The challenge provides a starter javascript file, but a typescript solution is
        required.
      </li>
      <li>
        The challenge provides a testing environment. The average number of turns and average run time at full speed for 100 maps will be
        the primary metrics.
      </li>
      <li>Please provide a rough estimate of the number of hours spent on your solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Challenge Info:</p>
    <p>
      You can learn the game mechanics with the <a href="challenge.html">testing engine</a> (use the arrow keys). The testing engine will
      automatically pull the file <a href="solution.js">solution.js</a> for automated testing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must implement a class named Stacker with a <b>turn</b> method that accepts a JSON object with information about the map and
      returns the action the agent should take. <a href="solution.js">Example Stacker Class</a>. The simulator will call this
      <b>turn</b> method once per game cycle.
    </p>
    <p>Exmaple of JSON the game passes as the paramter of the <b>turn</b> method</p>
    <pre>
			{
				left: { type: someValue, level: someValue },
				up: { type: someValue, level: someValue },
				right: { type: someValue, level: someValue },
				down: { type: someValue, level: someValue },
				type: someValue,
				level: someValue
			}
		</pre
    >
    <p>There are three types of tiles on the map. All are traversable except walls.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0 (empty)</li>
      <li>1 (wall)</li>
      <li>2 (block)</li>
      <li>3 (gold)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All tiles also have an associated non-negative integer level (elevation off the ground). Empty cells are always at ground zero. Your
      agent can only move up or down by one level at a time.
    </p>
    <p>Your turn method must then return a string representing one of six possible actions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"left"</li>
      <li>"up"</li>
      <li>"right"</li>
      <li>"down"</li>
      <li>"pickup"</li>
      <li>"drop"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The simulator will only count a turn if the action you specified was legal. So if you try to pickup a non-existent block, it simply
      does nothing.
    </p>
    <p>You can begin writing your solution in solution.js</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
